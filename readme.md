Warframe Market Helper

Current Version: 0.1.0


A tool to check prices of tradable warframe inventory items, and sort what is and isn't worth selling.

Currently builds a list of items with various metadata about provided inventory items.

Very buggy, and very much a work in progress. Use at your own risk.


To Do: 

Check API for item values.

Compare ducat values to prices.

Auto generate lists of items above and below sales threshold.


To Fix: Outputting typos correctly, notifying user.


Future:

Implement auto listing to market.

UI?


Dependencies: 

pandas (pip install pandas)


Input file should be a csv file.

To use: run "python3 main.py <path to file>" within wfmhelper directory.
